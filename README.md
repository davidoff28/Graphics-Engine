# Graphics-Engine
This is a simple graphics engine in C# that uses OpenGL and GLFW C# wrapper librarys. This is a personal project that I've been slowly working on in my spare time.
As it is I hope that this gives some guidance to anybody who wants to use C# when learning opengl.  

# Librarys Used
OpenGL: https://github.com/luca-piccioni/OpenGL.Net
GLFW: https://github.com/Chman/Glfw.Net

# Resources
Game Engine Book: http://gameenginebook.com/ 
Highly Recommend buying this book if you plan on creating your own engine. Very informative and detailed, plus its written by Jason Gregory who works at Naughty Dog.

LearnOpenGl: https://learnopengl.com/
Fantastic website to get started on OpenGl programming. This project is based on those tutorials.

Opengl: https://www.khronos.org/files/opengl45-quick-reference-card.pdf
Opengl API reference card for quickly finding functions.

Opengl superbible 7th edition: https://www.amazon.co.uk/OpenGL-Superbible-Comprehensive-Tutorial-Reference/dp/0672337479
Great book to use, highly informative. I'm slowly reading my way through this.

# Future
Once I get my free time I plan on coming back to this engine and learn and develop this further.
